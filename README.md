# trex-slider-jscript
pure javascript and css slideshow

# information
Reference src is for example only. Usage for real world application would require to strip all of head and the body/html tags then copy the HTML into a page. Each page could be altered to have captions and content relevent to each Trex product.

Thumbnails are not clickable. This would take an addition to the scripts. The themed layout is for nine images. So technically the thumbnails are currently just to display "which" pictures are in the, albeit short, slideshow.
